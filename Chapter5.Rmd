# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (Excercise 5)

#### 1.Read data and look into dataset
```{r}
library(readr);library(dplyr)
human <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/human1.txt", sep=",", header=T)
str(human);dim(human);summary(human)
```
*195 oberservations and 19 variables - 1 variable among 20variables at the first column in the dataset was just removed, which was the numering for the observations.* 
```{r}
str(human$GNI)

```
